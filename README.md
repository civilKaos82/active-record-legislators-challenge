# Working with Legislator Data

## Summary
This challenge is a fairly comprehensive reflection of our understanding of and abilities in applying object-oriented principles, schema design, and Active Record.  The challenge is to build a command line application that allows us to interact with data on U.S. legislators.  We'll be designing a database to hold data pulled from the [Sunlight Foundation][Sunlight Foundation].

We'll be given a list of required functionality for our application, but it's up to us to figure out how to build out that functionality.  What tables should our database have?  What models do we need?  What are the relationships between our classes?  What about views and controllers?  How will we get input from users?  We'll need to make and implement all of these decision ourselves.

### Required Functionality

For a given state ...
- obtain a list of all the state's legislators.
- obtain a list of just the state's representatives.
- obtain a list of just the state's senators

For a given political party ...
- obtain a list of legislators affiliated with the party.
- obtain a list of representatives affiliated with the party.
